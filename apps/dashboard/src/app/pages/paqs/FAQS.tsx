        'Very early stage technology commercialization funds are extremely limited in the WNY region. This is the most difficult money to raise because, as first money in, it has higher risks and takes longer to bring a return on investment. While there are some entrepreneur support programs currently at UB including Blackstone Launchpad entrepreneur center, NSF I-Corps Site Program and the Baird Technology Incubator, they are not at the scale necessary to provide the depth of outreach and support needed. UBâ€™s incubators, especially wet lab space, is almost full and there is demand for additional space. This complements other programs in WNY and continues to build the entrepreneur ecosystem.',
